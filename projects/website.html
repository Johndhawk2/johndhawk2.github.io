				Overview

					In the modern, technological age, every advisor will tell you that you need an online presence.
					Granted they're usually referring to fully fledged businesses, but it can't hurt to have a personal
					website. These days, a CV is not enough to show off who you are as a person, what skills you have,
					and what you have achieved, so it's important to have somewhere employers or other interested
					parties can find out more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore I set out to crate a website that would allow me to show off who I am and what I do, in
					greater depth than a CV could. There were a few things I wanted the website to be able to do. It
					should:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide information about who I am and what sort of person I am</li>
					<li>Allow people to view a curated list of the projects I've undertaken, whether for work or fun
					</li>
					<li>Provide a way for people to contact me</li>
					<li>Work well on a range of devices, so anyone can access it</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					On top of this I wanted the website itself to be a way for me to display my wide range of abilities,
					so I decided to code everything from scratch, and to set up my own web server.

				<!--<img src="../Images/Projects/website.png" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="400" style="float: right;">-->
				<p>I started off by reasearching good website designing tools so that I could get an idea of how I
					wanted the site to look, before I spent the time creating it. While there are a lot of great online
					website builders (such as Wix or Squarespace), I wanted something that wouldn't result in a usable
					website, but rather a functioning prototype I could start coding. In the end, I found two potential
					programmes, Mobirise and Adobe XD. Mobirise is an offline website designer, aimed at non-techincally
					inclined people which uses premade "block" to allow the user to quickly and easily produce a
					webstie. While this is closer to what I was looking for, the free version of the software was fairly
					limited, and the overall product was fairly restricted by the design blocks they provided.</p>
				<p>This then left Adobe XD. Adobe XD is not a dedicated website designer as with the other options, but
					rather a universal UX design tool predominantly meant for creating web or mobile apps. This meant
					that I could easily create a mock up of the precise design I wanted, while also testing how it would
					flow by using the in built interactive prototyping tools. Using Adobe XD, I created two designs for
					the website, one to use on desktop screens, and one for mobile.</p>
				<p>The next step was to take this mock up design, and convert it into the code for the final website. I
					wanted to maintain control over the website, and to gain a deeper understanding of the core of web
					development, so I opted to stick to pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where possible. Where not
					possible, or simply to make life slightly easier, I also used Bootstrap and JQuery, as these could
					make coding the site much quicker and simpler, without giving up the fine control I wanted.</p>
				<p>The core design of the website is based around four tabs. This allows me to separate the various
					sections of the site and keep everything looking neat and clean. The traditional way to accomplish
					this look, would be to have four separate webpages and to have the navbar at the top contain links
					to each page. However, this approach causes the entire page to reload whenever a new tab is
					selected, which felt cumbersome and outdated. So I turned to bootstrap, more specifically to the tab
					feature. Bootstrap tabs allow you to have a navigation bar that controls a content area and fades
					nicely between content when the appropriate tab is selected. Almost perfect! The biggest issue was
					that each of my tab designs had a different background across the entire page, whereas bootstrap
					tabs only control a portion of the screen.</p>
				<p>To get around this limitation, I split each tab in to two parts. One &lt;div&gt; tag containing all
					of the content of the page shown below the navigation bar, and One &lt;div&gt; tag containing the
					background image. The content was set to use the standard bootstrap tab system, but the images had
					to be controlled with additional JavaScript programming. A function was set up to occur whenever a
					new tab was selected, it grabs the new tab, and the current one, and controls the fading of the
					background images to ensure that there's a seamless transition to the new tab. This produced the
					desired effect of each tab appearing as a completely new webpage, while never completely refreshing
					the page, and allowing for smooth fading between each section. All that remained with the navigation
					bar was to improve the look of the default navigation bar. None of the bootstrap options fitted the
					aesthetic of the rest of the webiste, so I completely rewrote the design using CSS and, where
					needed, the <mark>!important</mark> command to ensure that my design choices overruled the bootstrap
					design.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Responsive design</li>
					<li>Overflow (scrolling)</li>
					<li>Hosting</li>
					<li>PHP Form</li>
