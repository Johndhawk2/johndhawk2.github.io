	The current diagnosis/treatment process revolves around occasional meetings between a doctor and their patient, or possibly measurements taken by patients. This leads to long periods of time where data, that could be helpful to the doctor, is unavailable or inaccurate. To solve this, a proposed device will be developed to act as a data collection and storage device. It will be worn constantly by the patient and will log data from sensors autonomously, and will be an open source platform to allow any sensors to connect, and store data, to the device. The interface between the device and the sensors will be based off the protocol with a custom data package structure. This proposed system will periodically communicate to all sensors connected to the network to gather their current values, and will then process and store the information on an SD card as a CSV for easy access of data. Patients would be able to view and potentially edit their data through a web-based application communicating with the device via the web Bluetooth protocol.
